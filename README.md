# Purpose of Project
This is an assignment to build test repository for DE. 
## Week2 update: 
I created two py files to test the make file and CI actions: hellp.py and test_hello.py. The hello.py contains a function to add two parameters provided, and the test_hello contains assert statements to check if the sum is correct.
## Week3 update: 
I performed EDA on the egrid data in the file pandas_test.py. The detailed report is in the profile report.pdf in the main branch.

# Preparation

Go through the make file.

# Egrid dataset

## Visualizations

Visualizations can be produced by the pandas_test.py. The below is the scatter plot between APFAC and PLNGENAN.
