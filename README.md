# Purpose of Project
This is an assignment to build test repository for DE. 
## Week2 update: 
I created two py files to test the make file and CI actions: "hellp.py" and "test_hello.py". The "hello.py" contains a function to add two parameters provided, and the "test_hello" contains assert statements to check if the sum is correct.
## Week3 update: 
I performed EDA on the egrid data in the file "pandas_test.py". The detailed report is in the "profile report.pdf" in the main branch.

# Preparation

Go through the make file.

# Egrid dataset

## Visualizations

The below visualization can be obtained by the pandas_test.py and it is saved as "descriptive_data.pdf".
